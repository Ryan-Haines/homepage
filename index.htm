					<h1>Flexible, Apt, Eager</h1>
					<p>I moved to the Bay Area for an internship over a year ago and immediately fell in love with the city. Since my arrival, my professional experience has spanned a breadth of responsibilities from developing a configuration tool for Software-Defined Network management to building responsive mobile websites for properties including Nature.org, The American Breast Cancer Society, and The Scholastic Store. These tasks were accomplished using varying amounts of Python, Javascript/jQuery, HTML/SASS, and a smattering of custom tools where the stack demanded it. At heart, I'm an OO Scala/Java developer who loves managing a project with a web of dependencies and have earned many scars under the Eclipse IDE. In my spare time I released an android port of the webapp located at the first google result for "wildflower identification" in order to make the tool available in the deep wilderness. I additionally ported tools for tree and bird identification . Cumulatively these applications have been installed through the android market over 27,000 times, and tree identification was open-sourced shortly after its release.</p>

					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>When I'm away from the computer you'll probably find me riding my bike around the city or playing Magic: The Gathering in Berkeley - I'm a longtime devotee of the game and have played in the competitive scene for over a decade. I'm also the type that loves to play Systems Administrator when it comes to gadgets - installing Doom on my iPod in grade school immediately got me hooked on the custom firmware scene. This was the seed of the tree that is my obsession with the nitty-gritty of the raw silicon we interact with every day, from massive cloud installations to a single iPhone.</p>

					<h1>Why you should be interested</h1>
					<p>I'm looking to help you blossom the front end of your product in whatever capacity you need, from maintaining your existing website to exploring what type of mobile solution would work best with your strategy. I have experience with all parts of this process, from inception to production and continued support. I have a knack for what does and doesn't make good UI/UX and I'll probably want to refactor some parts of your codebase after getting comfortable with it. I work best in smaller teams where teamwork happens as an n-clique, not a couple of senior developers delegating workflow to their underlings.</p>
